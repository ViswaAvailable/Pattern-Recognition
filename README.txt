WORKING DIRECTORY:

Phase I:

1. Extract the data set

2. Creation of a new column Death from existing column Date_died is created which when equal to 0 means the patient has died and 1 meaning otherwise

3.Conversion of date variables to Pandas Datetime.

4. Finding the duration as the time (day) between the day the symptoms started showing and the day the patient went to the hospital for check up.

5. Changing values of the column ICU to add meaning. 



Phase II:

1.Data is cleaned for processing and data visualization of missing data is done.

2.Correlating different parameters to death.

3.Visualising number of people who died.

4.Taking a particular factor and seeing its role in death.



Phase III:

1.Using logistic regression to model relationship between independent variables and response variable.

2.95% confidence interval for odds difference between levels is calculated and further interpretation of parameters are done.
